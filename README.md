# Unevenly-spaced-Time-Series-uts-Analysis
Short analyses of an Unevenly-spaced Time Series (UTS) in Pennsylvania, USA, from 07 Jan 2016 to 09 Aug 2016.

The `accumRainfall.csv` file contains 91 Unix timestamp and corresponding accumulated rainfall (inch) in 1 hour duration. 
It is vague with very limited information provided, and is actually a Unicode Text (.txt) file.



The `.R` file contains visualisation and predictions.

In 1998, Aksoy published that Gamma distribution was considered to be an appropriate approach to model rainfall. (*Use Gamma Distribution in Hydrology Analysis*)

Later in 2010, *Dan'azumi et al.* published the result of hourly rainfall modelling in Malaysia. An Generalised Pareto distribution was found to be the most suitable model particularly for Malaysia. (*Modelling the Distribution of Rainfall Intensity using Hourly Data*)

Therefore, the contributor performed Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (Loess) and Generalized Linear Model as analysing tool. 

The `peak_interval_rgamma_rgpd.R` file generates 60 random rainfall numbers for each different day, assuming the underlying distribution is Gamma/GPD respectively. The crucial assumption is *minute rainfall amounts are iid*, which could be easily violated!
- The peak 30-min interval is 18:00--18:30 for gamma, and 18:01--18:31 for GPD.

# Process:

- First, the data set has been resaved as a real .csv file before imported into R.
- Plotting rainfall amount against date to visualise the trend line within the supplied range.
- Fit glm with family = gamma and gpd respectively, plotting fitted values and trend on the original plot to see their behaves. 

- Then, as mentioned, the original data set was unevenly spaced (2016-01-07, 2016-01-08, 2016-01-09, 2016-01-13, 2016-01-14, etc.). Thus a Stineman interpolation has been applied to compute the missing data.
- Fit Loess regression and GLMs with the interpolated data set, plotting the smoothed curves and compare their behavious.


- Finally, the de-accumulated rainfall amount within each 1-hour duration from the original dataset were calculated, based on Loess regression. Also, the corresponding 30-minute peak interval have been computed.

# Future work:
- [ ] The contributor should consider split the data into training/ test subset, to see how models behave.
- [x] Also, predict result of gamma/ GPD distribution should be illustrated.
- [ ] In 2015, *Hanum et al.* published the method of *Modelling Extreme Rainfall with Gamma-Pareto Distribution.*
- [ ] Furthermore, embedded/ anonymous function should be considered, to serve for a large range of input data (from .RData, SQL server, etc.) .
- [ ] Using Gumbel distribution to find peak value.

# Note: 
(Basic hydrology knowledge for the contributor)
- If observation numbers are large enough, maximum rainfall has a Gumbel distribution.
- PA belongs to SCS Type II curve.

- To define the coefficient of the IDF curve, Requires Duration of the storm and return period.
i = a/(t+b)<sup>c</sup>, i is the rainfall intensity (inch/hrs)
1. SCS method
2. Triangular Hyyetograph Method
3. Alternating block method

- To identify *the range of peak rate* Q<sub>peak</sub>, requires Drainage area, Runoff CN, Time of concentration. Modefied 1-hrs CN = 92.6 instead 24-hrs standard NRCS CN = 74.
